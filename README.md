Assignment submission format

Each student has to submit their assignment as guided in the assignment brief. The students are guided what sort of information is to produce to meet the criteria targeted.  Prepare the assignment as guided below.

Scenario




Himalaya Organic Farm is an agro-industrial corporation with vast plantations and factories in the north of Nepal. With its huge labor force its human resources department formerly had a flat file system for handling employee information. This wasn’t quite good as it couldn’t meet up with the ever changing needs of the corporation. The aim of this project is to build a system whereby Himalaya Organic Farm can safely keep and manage employee information. It is to act a source of knowledge for strategic decision making by Himalaya Organic Farm management and other external agencies connected to the corporation.

The following are the requirements of the software for managing the Employee Management System.




This system is used by two users Admin and Employee.

Functionality performed by Admin Users:

Login for Admin

Logout functionality

Dashboard for Admin User

You must implement following technologies.

<ol>

 <li>Html 2. Bootstrap 3. C# 4. .netcore   5. EntityframeworkCore   6. Mssql  7. Visual studio</li>

</ol>

2017/2019

<ol start="8">

 <li>You must implement Repository pattern.</li>

</ol>




In order to convince the management that you can work independently, you need to demonstrate that you understand the principles of programming in .Net Core (MVC), and are able to design, implement and test and document .Net solutions.

Learning Outcomes Covered

LO1: Examine the key components related to the object oriented programming paradigm, analyzing design pattern types.

LO2: Design a series of UML class diagram.

LO3: Implement code applying design patterns.

LO4: Investigate scenarios with respect to design pattern.




Part 1

Produce a presentation and there will be viva for following too:

<ul>

 <li>Examine the characteristics of the object-orientated paradigm as well as the various class relationships.</li>

 <li>Determine a design pattern from each of the creational, structural and behavioral pattern types.</li>

 <li>Analyze the relationship between the object-orientated paradigm and design patterns.</li>

</ul>

NOTE: IN part 1, Screenshot of presentation slides as well as video of your presentation is required.




Part 2

Design a series of UML class diagram:

<ul>

 <li>Design and build class diagrams using a UML tool.</li>

 <li>Define class diagrams for specific design patterns using a UML tool.</li>

 <li>Define/refine class diagrams derived from a given code scenario using a UML tool.</li>

</ul>

Part 3

Create a lab report to show that you have implement code applying design pattern:

<ul>

 <li>Build an application derived from UML class diagrams.</li>

 <li>Develop code that implements a design pattern for a given purpose.</li>

 <li>Evaluate the use of design patterns for the given purpose specified in M3.</li>

</ul>

Part 4

Write an article about your investigation on scenarios with respect to design pattern.

<ul>

 <li>Discuss a range of design patterns with relevant examples of creational, structural and behavioral pattern types.</li>

 <li>Reconcile the most appropriate design pattern from a range with a series of given scenarios.</li>

 <li>Critically evaluate a range of design patterns against the range of given scenarios with justification of your choices.</li>

</ul>
